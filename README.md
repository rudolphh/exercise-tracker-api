Exercise Tracker API is written in JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, and uses several open-source libraries : 
* [NodeJS] - a cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
* [Express] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [Mongoose] - a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* [MongoDB] - a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program.

And of course this is open source with a [public repository][exercise-tracker-api] on GitHub.
